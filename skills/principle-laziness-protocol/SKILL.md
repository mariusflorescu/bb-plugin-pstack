# Laziness Protocol

Aim for the most result with the least code and complexity.

- **Prefer deletion.** When asked to refactor or improve, look for removals before additions.
- **Maintain a flat call hierarchy.** Avoid deep call chains. A rich interface that hides substantial work is not a deep call chain. If answering a question requires tracing through more than 3 files or layers, flatten it.
- **Consolidate decisions.** Do not repeat the same choice in several places. Put it behind one source of truth and pass the result as a simple flag.
- **Minimize the diff.** Make the smallest change that solves the problem. Fewer lines beat "elegant" boilerplate.
- **Question the threading.** If a task asks you to pass a new signal through types, schemas, pipelines, or similar layers, stop and look for a more direct path.
- **Sweat the small leaks.** Remove tiny pass-throughs, representation leaks, and duplicated choices before they spread. Small leaks compound into permanent coordination costs.

**The test:** If a human developer would find the code exhausting to maintain, it is a bad solution.

This copy is harness and provider agnostic. Model names, delegation APIs, transcript paths, question tools, config files, and hosting/secret mechanisms that were specific to the upstream author's environment are replaced with instructions to discover what the running harness actually offers. Where a needed capability is absent, the instruction says to surface that rather than silently substituting a paid or fabricated default. Upstream names appearing below inside examples or historical notes are inactive references, not instructions.
