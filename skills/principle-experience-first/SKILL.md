# Experience First

When implementation convenience conflicts with user delight, choose delight.

- Every feature, control, and option must be justified
- Ship less, ship better (polished experience with three features beats rough one with ten)
- Prototype before committing (design decisions are cheaper in throwaway HTML than production code)
- Get the details right (transitions, alignment, spacing, feedback, error states)
- Tighten the core loop (every feature should serve the central workflow or get out of the way)

The user is whoever consumes the work. For a UI that is the end user. For a library or an internal API it is the colleague who imports it. The engineer who maintains the code next is a user too. Weigh their experience the same way, and explain impact from their perspective.

Foundations should serve the experience. Foundational thinking governs the *sequence* of work. This principle governs the *target*.

This copy is harness and provider agnostic. Model names, delegation APIs, transcript paths, question tools, config files, and hosting/secret mechanisms that were specific to the upstream author's environment are replaced with instructions to discover what the running harness actually offers. Where a needed capability is absent, the instruction says to surface that rather than silently substituting a paid or fabricated default. Upstream names appearing below inside examples or historical notes are inactive references, not instructions.
