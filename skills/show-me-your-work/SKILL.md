# Show me your work

Keep one canonical log.

## The format

A single TSV file, one row per decision. Cells stay single-line. Evidence is a pointer, not prose.

Copy `references/decision-log-template.tsv` (the header row) to start a clean log. Columns:

- **ts.** ISO8601 timestamp.
- **phase.** The phase or workstream.
- **decision.** What was chosen or done, one line.
- **why.** The reason in plain words. If a principle drove it, say it plainly, not as a jargon tag.
- **evidence.** A link or path that proves it: commit SHA, PR number, `file:line`, or an artifact, trace, or screenshot path. Never a paragraph.
- **result.** The outcome or predicate state: `tests green`, `reverted`, `pixel-diff 0`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, `open`.

An example, plain-spoken so a reviewer reads it at a glance.

```
ts	phase	decision	why	evidence	result
2026-05-24T09:02:00Z	frame	counted the work first, about 100 components and roughly 75 hours	wanted to know the size before starting a long run	commit 3a9f1c2	found 5 things to sort out before starting
2026-05-24T09:40:00Z	harness	took screenshots of the old version before changing anything	so we can compare old against new and catch any visual change	scripts/snapshot.sh, baseline/	saved 120 reference screenshots
2026-05-24T11:15:00Z	widget	moved the widget styles over without changing how it looks	keep the change small and the result identical	commit 7c21e0a, pixel-diff 0	looks identical, tests pass
2026-05-24T12:30:00Z	widget	threw out a helper's work because its screenshots were blank	checked the real files instead of trusting its summary	worktree reset	reverted, tightened the instructions for next time
```

## Logging a row

Write each entry the way you'd tell a teammate what you did. Plain words, concrete actions, no AI speak or abstract jargon (the **unslop** skill applies to log text too).

Use the helper `scripts/log.sh <logfile> <phase> <decision> <why> <evidence> <result>`. It stamps `ts`, writes the header on first use, strips stray tabs/newlines, and prefixes any cell starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` with a single quote. A bare `printf` appending a row works too, but mind those same bytes if cells come from generated or user-supplied text.

Log decision points and checkpoints, not every action: a fork chosen, a unit completed with its verification result, a pivot or revert with its trigger, a blocker surfaced, a gate fixed. For loop runs, one row per iteration. Skip the trivial and self-evident.

A run is one agent conversation, including its later turns and any summary of it. A pickup, a replacement agent, or a new chat starts a new run. When a run adds to a log that already has rows, its first row has phase `start`, and so does its first row after another run's `start` row. So a run that comes back to a log in a later turn first reads the log's last rows to see whether another run wrote since. A `start` row names the `ts` range of the rows before it that this run did not write, and its evidence names this run as `<thread ID>@<seq>`: this thread's ID (`$BB_THREAD_ID`) and the event sequence the run starts after, which `scripts/run-start.sh` prints. A `bb thread clear` starts a new run in the same thread, so the ID alone does not name the run. Use phase `start` for nothing else.

## Where it lives

By default the log is a working artifact, not committed. Keep it at `decisions.tsv` in the work dir, or `.audit/<task-slug>.tsv` when several efforts run at once, and leave it out of git.

Commit it only when the work is ambitious enough that a reviewer needs the trail to trust the result.

## Rules

- Append-only. A wrong call gets a new row that supersedes it. Never edit or delete history.
- Prefer evidence produced by committed scripts over hand-made one-offs (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill).

## Audit the log against the transcript

At the end of the run, before handing back, check the log told the truth. Save this run's transcript as raw events (`bb thread log --self --format json --all --after-seq <seq> > "$BB_THREAD_STORAGE/transcript.json"`, with this run's `<seq>` from `scripts/run-start.sh`) and check against those. The verbose timeline can drop a command's output, so it cannot confirm evidence. Work this run delegated sits in the logs of the threads it delegated to, which `scripts/descendants.sh "$BB_THREAD_ID" <seq>` lists at every depth (children, their children, hidden ones included), each with the sequence its part of the run starts after: `0` for a thread made during its parent's part of the run, and the event just before the parent's first `bb thread tell` in that part for an older one. A clear keeps earlier runs' children, and the list leaves out those the run never messaged. Read each listed thread the same way, with `--after-seq` at its listed sequence. Read nothing beyond this run's part of this thread and of that list. Other threads hold unrelated private chats. Walk this run's rows against what actually happened. Each stretch of them begins at one of this run's `start` rows (evidence naming this run's `<thread ID>@<seq>`), or at the first row if this run created the log, and ends at the next `start` row of another run:

- Check that every row maps to a real decision or action.
- Check that each row's evidence resolves and shows what the row claims.
- A fork, pivot, or abandoned approach that shaped the work but isn't logged is a gap. Add it.

Correct the log, not the story. The audit never edits or removes a row, even an invented one. When a row records neither a real decision nor a real action, or its claim or evidence is wrong, add a row that supersedes it with what actually happened and a pointer that resolves. This audit does not check rows outside this run's stretches. If this run's own work shows one of them is wrong, supersede it like any wrong call.

## Cross-model review of the trail

Before handing back, spawn a child thread on a different model family from the one that did the work. Per the pstack delegation rules, take the first `arena cross-judge pool` entry whose model family differs from yours. If the pool has none, pick a model of another family from `bb provider models <provider> --environment "$BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID" --json` across the providers `bb provider list --environment "$BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID" --json` marks `available`, at its `defaultReasoningEffort`. If this host offers no other family, do not run a same-family review, and report in the Attention section that the cross-model review is incomplete. Self-review is not a substitute. Its brief says read-only and gives the log's path, this run's `<thread ID>@<seq>` and the descendant list from the audit. The reviewer reads the audit trail, the run's transcript (`bb thread log <thread ID> --format json --all --after-seq <seq>`) and each listed descendant's log after its listed sequence, and nothing else, then flags what the user should pay attention to. Not a redo of the work, a scan for what's suboptimal or risky.

- Decisions logged with weak or absent evidence.
- Verification steps skipped or claimed without proof in the transcript.
- Choices that look risky in hindsight (premature, scope-creeping, papering over a symptom).
- Gaps the user would otherwise miss on a casual skim.

Every reply for a run that produced a trail ends with an "Attention" section. Lead with the reviewer's model on its own line (`reviewed by <model>`), or, when this host offers no other family, with `cross-model review incomplete: no other model family on this host`, then list each flag pointing to specific rows or moments. "No flags" is a valid value. The model name is not.

## Reviewing the trail

Read top to bottom, follow the evidence pointers, spot-check. GitHub renders a committed TSV as a table. `column -s$'\t' -t decisions.tsv` renders it in a terminal.

## Composing this skill

Other skills route their audit trail here instead of inventing one. Reference it by name and let it own the format. Don't restate the columns.
