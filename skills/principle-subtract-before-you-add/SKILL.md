# Subtract Before You Add

When evolving a system, remove complexity first, then build.

**Why:** Adding to a complex system compounds complexity. Removing first leaves less code, reveals the essential structure, and usually makes the next design obvious. Default to subtraction.

Make simplification a continual investment. Leave the design slightly simpler and more capable behind the same or smaller surface than you found it.

**The pattern:**
- Sequence removal before construction
- Cut before you polish (get to the minimum before investing in quality)
- Design for observed usage, not speculative edge cases
- No speculative validators, parsers, or guards beyond what the spec demands
- Simplify prompts (remove redundant instructions, excessive templates)
- When a reference has no novel content, delete it rather than leaving a stub

This copy is harness and provider agnostic. Model names, delegation APIs, transcript paths, question tools, config files, and hosting/secret mechanisms that were specific to the upstream author's environment are replaced with instructions to discover what the running harness actually offers. Where a needed capability is absent, the instruction says to surface that rather than silently substituting a paid or fabricated default. Upstream names appearing below inside examples or historical notes are inactive references, not instructions.
